# Fedora image: turbo-spoon
A custom image based on Fedora Silverblue, designed for my personal use case. \
Feel free to give it a try though. :)
 
To pull this image use:
 
`sudo rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/my-declarative-pc/silverblue-setup__main:latest`
 
Heavily inspired by [uBlue](https://github.com/ublue-os/base).
